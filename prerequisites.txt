Displaying HTML file from Chrome

Problem Definition:
I want a server program that responds HTTP message to send data of HTML file!

Requirements:
- Display HTML file on Chrome
- Needs to accept an HTTP request message 
- Parse the HTTP message 
- Generate HTTP message
- Send HTTP message (that displays the file)

Architecture:
-logic to generate an HTTP message from parsed message
-logic to parse the accepted message so the generator
 can generate a response message (parsing constraint?)
-logic to accept HTTP request
-logic to send the generated response message 
 (this logic is probably going to be really short)

- a container to hold the generated response message
